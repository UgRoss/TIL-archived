The HTML Bidirectional Text Override element `<bdo>` overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.

```html
<bdo dir="rtl">Hello</bdo> World!
```

- `dir="rtl"` - Text goes from rifght to left
- `dir="ltr"` - Text goes from left to right
