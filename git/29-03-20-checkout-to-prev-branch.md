# Git checkout to previous branch

```sh
git checkout @{-1}
# or
git checkout - # equivalent to @{-1}
```

This will move you back to the branch you were on previously.


> You can use the @{-N} syntax to refer to the N-th last branch/commit checked out using "git checkout" operation. You may also specify - which is synonymous to @{-1}.
